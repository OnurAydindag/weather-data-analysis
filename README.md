# Weather Data Analysis

This project demonstrates basic data analysis tasks implemented using Python. The work was performed on Google Colab using the `weather_data.csv` dataset.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Google Colab

---

## File Contents

* `weather-data-analysis.ipynb` → Contains all code for the project
* `weather_data.csv` → Dataset used for analysis
* `city_temperatures.xlsx` → Excel output with average temperatures by city

---

## Workflow

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Library and Data Loading**

   * Imported Pandas and NumPy libraries
   * Loaded the CSV dataset

2. **Data Exploration**

   * Displayed the first and last rows of the dataset (head and tail)
   * Generated statistical summary using `describe`

3. **Column Selection**

   * Selected specific columns for analysis

4. **Filtering**

   * Applied simple and logical filters

5. **Sorting**

   * Sorted data by temperature, humidity, and city

6. **Adding New Columns**

   * Converted temperature to Fahrenheit
   * Added `FeelsLike` temperature

7. **Grouping**

   * Calculated record counts and average temperature per city

8. **Max / Min Analysis**

   * Identified rows with maximum temperature and minimum humidity

9. **Exporting Results**

   * Exported average city temperatures to an Excel file
